# Superlog onboarding

Wire OpenTelemetry traces, logs, and metrics into the user's project so telemetry streams to Superlog. Cover **every app and service in the repo** — not just the one the user is currently sitting in.

Prefer native OpenTelemetry APIs and the framework's documented bootstrap over custom helper layers. If a specific stack stumps you, search the OTel docs for that language; don't guess.

Before editing, read the applicable companion skills:

- `otel-onboarding-style` for general OTel taste.
- `otel-python-style` for Python services.
- `otel-fastapi-style` for FastAPI services.
- `otel-livekit-style` for LiveKit agents.
- `otel-nextjs-style` for Next.js/Vercel apps.
- `otel-expo-style` for Expo / React Native apps.
- `otel-supabase-edge-style` for Supabase Edge Functions.

## Step 0 — Endpoint and key handling

The **OTLP endpoint** is always `https://intake.superlog.sh`.

The **ingest API key** starts with `superlog_live_` and is project-scoped + write-only. It's a secret: **never embed it as a literal in source files.** It only ever goes into env files (`.env.local`, `.env.superlog`, the language equivalent) read at runtime.

Don't block on the key up front — instrumentation is mostly the same whether the key exists yet or not, and asking for it before the user has seen what they're getting kills the flow. Two paths:

- **If the user already has a key**, accept it and use it everywhere the env files want it.
- **If they don't** (no key visible in their existing config, no answer when you ask), use the literal sentinel `SUPERLOG_TEST` as the key. Superlog's ingest accepts `SUPERLOG_TEST` from anyone — it returns 200 to the OTLP exporter without forwarding anywhere. This lets the user's app boot, exercise the OTel bootstrap path, and emit telemetry calls end-to-end before they sign up. They swap `SUPERLOG_TEST` for a real `superlog_live_…` after signup and real telemetry starts flowing.

Either way, do the install work first. Sign-up happens at the end (Step 5).

## Step 1 — Map every app/service in the repo

Before instrumenting anything, enumerate what's here. Check workspace manifests (`pnpm-workspace.yaml`, root `package.json` `workspaces`, `go.work`, Cargo workspace, Python `pyproject.toml` workspace setups, `apps/*` and `services/*` conventions). Identify each service: web frontend, API, workers, background jobs, CLIs, sample/demo apps, mobile apps, Supabase and/or server functions. Mobile and serverless/edge functions are in scope; do not skip them merely because they are client-side or short-lived. Skip pure type/config packages with no runtime entry point. Do not skip any runnable services or leave them "out of scope": instrument absolutely everything in this run; there may be no follow-up.

Show the user the list before you start, so they can correct it.

## Step 2 — For each service, install native OTel and bootstrap

**Use the language's native OpenTelemetry SDK.** Don't reach for vendor wrappers or hand-rolled helpers when an official package exists. Examples of what "native" means here: `@opentelemetry/sdk-node` for Node servers, `@vercel/otel` for normal Next.js/Vercel apps (sdk-node breaks Next's webpack and misses the framework bootstrap), `@opentelemetry/sdk-trace-web` + browser/mobile-compatible exporters for Vite/SPA/Expo, `opentelemetry-instrumentation-*` + `opentelemetry-sdk` for Python, `go.opentelemetry.io/otel` for Go.

No broad wrapper APIs. Avoid reusable helpers like `sendSuperlogSpan`, `recordCounter`, `recordLog`, `startTelemetrySpan`, or `withTelemetry`. Acquire native tracers/meters/loggers at module scope and use the SDK's own APIs directly. In TypeScript/JavaScript, use the published `@superlog/otel-helpers` `withSpan` helper for bounded business spans and add `@superlog/otel-helpers` to `package.json`; this is required when the package can be installed because it avoids expanding a whole function into `startActiveSpan` plus `try` / `catch` / `finally`. Do not use helpers around provider SDK calls that OpenInference/provider instrumentation can observe directly. If an edge runtime genuinely cannot load an upstream OTel SDK, keep the shim tiny, provider-neutral, and OTel-shaped: `tracer.startActiveSpan`, `span.setAttributes`, `SpanStatusCode`, `meter.createCounter`, `histogram.record`.

Wire all three signals — traces, logs, metrics. **Logs go through OTLP, not just stdout** — set up the OTel log bridge for the language so app logs (with their existing log levels and structured fields) carry the active `trace_id` / `span_id` automatically. The user's existing logger keeps working; you're just adding an OTLP handler/processor underneath.

Bootstrap rules:
- The bootstrap file must run before any framework imports. Use the language/framework's documented hook (`--import` flag, `instrumentation.ts`, top-of-`main.py` import, etc.).
- Read the endpoint and key from env. If the auth header is missing, log one clear warning and leave the app running in no-op/disabled mode rather than silently dropping telemetry or crashing local dev.
- Use HTTP OTLP exporters, not gRPC. gRPC pulls in native bindings that break bundlers and complicate containers.
- Use the project's existing package manager (detect via lockfile).
- Prefer idempotent edits. If a config file already exists, edit don't overwrite.

Framework rules:
- **Next.js/Vercel:** use `instrumentation.ts` with `@vercel/otel` `registerOTel(...)` as the bootstrap. Do not substitute a raw `@opentelemetry/sdk-node` / `NodeSDK` bootstrap unless the repo already uses that architecture and you are extending it. Use `@opentelemetry/api` tracers/meters inside route handlers only where auto-instrumentation is blind.
- **Expo/React Native:** preserve existing Expo Go / unsupported-runtime guards. In supported builds, call `initObservability()` before Sentry and before app registration/user code. Use public env vars like `EXPO_PUBLIC_OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`, `EXPO_PUBLIC_OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS`, and `EXPO_PUBLIC_OTEL_SERVICE_NAME`.
- **Supabase Edge Functions:** native Deno OpenTelemetry does not work in hosted Supabase Edge today. Use the tiny OTel-shaped shim pattern above; keep exporter endpoint/headers in one setup area and avoid Superlog-specific function/file names.
- **Python/FastAPI:** use native instrumentation such as `FastAPIInstrumentor.instrument_app(app)` rather than replacing request handling with manual middleware.
- **Python/LiveKit:** lifecycle spans that cross shutdown callbacks may use `start_span` + `trace.use_span(..., end_on_exit=False)` and end in the shutdown callback. Bounded work should still use decorators or context managers.

**Coexist with existing observability vendors. Don't remove Sentry, Datadog, New Relic, Honeycomb, Logtail, Pino transports, etc.** OTel sits alongside them. The user explicitly wants both signals flowing during migration; ripping out the incumbent is not your call.

## Step 3 — Add custom spans, metrics, and logs around business operations

Auto-instrumentation gets you HTTP in/out, DB queries, framework lifecycle. That's the floor, not the ceiling. Read the project to find the operations a human operator would actually want to see when something looks wrong.

### Traces

Wrap **every critical business operation** with an active span. Auto-instrumented spans are fine where they exist — but if an operation isn't already getting a span, add one.

- Naming: `domain.verb` (`order.process`, `payment.charge`, `email.send`, `agent.run`, `interview.create`, `job.<type>`).
- Attributes: entity IDs (order.id, user.id, workspace.id, tenant.id), counts, key boolean branch outcomes, model name / provider for LLM calls.
- Record exceptions: `span.recordException(err)` + `span.setStatus({ code: ERROR })` on failure paths.
- For Python functions with clear boundaries, prefer `@tracer.start_as_current_span("operation.name")`. Use a context manager when a decorator does not fit. Do not use detached `start_span()` + manual `end()` for bounded work.
- Skip trivial getters, pure transforms, internal helpers — anything with no real latency or failure mode.
- **Never put PII in attributes** (emails, passwords, tokens, full request bodies).

### Logs

Make sure logs are **structured and carry operation context**. Concretely: every log line emitted inside a span should arrive at Superlog with `trace_id` / `span_id` populated and any structured fields (orderId, userId, etc.) preserved as attributes. Trace/span context may be added natively by the log bridge or integration, or may require additional work.

Use logs for narrative ("starting batch reconcile", "retrying after 3xx") and exceptional events. An error log must only be emitted if the operation cannot recover and manual intervention is required.

### Metrics

Cover **business + performance + cost**. Three categories to look for:

- **Business logic counters.** Every meaningful state transition: created, started, completed, failed, retried. Per-tenant, per-channel, per-status — low-cardinality dimensions only (never user/order IDs).
- **Performance histograms.** Latency of operations the user cares about, queue depth, batch sizes, payload sizes. Reuse existing timing instrumentation if the project already has any (`time.perf_counter` blocks, custom `LatencyTracker`s, "[TIMING]" log lines) — emit a histogram from those measurements rather than measuring twice.
- **Costs — especially LLM costs.** If the project calls OpenAI / Anthropic / Google / any LLM provider, prefer provider instrumentation such as OpenInference where available so native SDK calls stay readable. Do not add pricing constants or LLM cost math in product handlers; Superlog computes estimated cost centrally in the UI/query layer from captured provider/model/token attributes. Avoid duplicating token counters already captured by provider instrumentation.

Get the meter once at module level, create instruments at module level, increment in the hot path. Don't create a fresh meter per call.

## Step 4 — Verify the app still works

Per service:

1. **Run the project's own dev or build command** (whatever its `package.json` / `pyproject` / `Makefile` already wires up). Confirm it starts cleanly with no errors that trace back to your OTel install. Also run a telemetry bootstrap smoke that imports or starts the app with the OTel env vars present, so provider setup, exporter construction, log bridging, and framework instrumentation all initialize. For a Python server this can be an import/startup command such as `uv run python -c 'from app.main import app; print(app.title)'`; for Node/Next use the repo's build/start path. For a server, hit at least one route with curl so traffic flows through the instrumentation; choose a route that exercises an instrumented operation when practical, not only a static health route. For a CLI, invoke a real command. **Don't ship if the app's own startup is now broken** — that's a regression.
2. **Confirm telemetry leaves the process.** With `SUPERLOG_TEST` (or a real key) in env, OTLP POSTs from the dev server should return 2xx — that proves the bootstrap is reaching the network. As an extra sanity check, you can `curl -X POST https://intake.superlog.sh/v1/traces -H "authorization: Bearer SUPERLOG_TEST" -H "content-type: application/json" -d '{}'` and confirm 200. The real signal is the running app's own POSTs succeeding by the time the dev server shuts down — if they don't, the bootstrap is wrong (most often: SDK loaded too late, or shutdown not flushing).

A bootstrap that loads but never POSTs is not a partial success. Fix it before moving on.

## Step 5 — Hand-off (final message to the user)

This is the closing message. Three blocks, in order. Auto-open the signup URL in the user's browser at the end.

### What changed

3–7 short factual bullets covering: packages installed, files created/modified, env vars written, business spans/metrics added. Per service if changes differed, grouped if uniform. Mention any existing observability vendor (Sentry, Datadog, Logtail, Pino transports, etc.) you intentionally left in place so the coexistence is explicit.

### Set these env vars to launch

Two env vars need to reach every runtime that runs the instrumented code (local dev, CI, prod):

- `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://intake.superlog.sh`
- `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS=authorization=Bearer <key>` — `<key>` is `SUPERLOG_TEST` until they swap it for a real `superlog_live_…` after signup.

For local dev, point at the `.env.local` / `.env.superlog` file you wrote — already done. For deploy, give **concrete instructions for the targets you actually detected in the repo**:

- `Dockerfile` / `docker-compose.yml` → `docker run -e OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=… -e OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS=…` (or service-level `environment:` in compose). Mention multi-stage builds shouldn't bake the key in.
- `vercel.json` / `.vercel/` → `vercel env add OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS production` (and same for `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`).
- `railway.json` / Railway already wired → `railway variables --set 'OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS=…' --service <name>`.
- `fly.toml` → `fly secrets set OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS=…`.
- `.github/workflows/*.yml` → repo Settings → Secrets → add as Actions secrets, then reference as `${{ secrets.OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS }}` in the workflow.
- `Procfile` / Heroku → `heroku config:set OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS=…`.
- Kubernetes manifests → add to a Secret and mount via `envFrom` / `valueFrom.secretKeyRef`.
- Otherwise → the generic shell-export form for whatever shell is in use.

Only mention targets that actually exist in the repo. Don't list every option as a wall of text.

### Get your key

Tell the user: "Opening Superlog signup in your browser — sign up, optionally connect GitHub, and copy your `superlog_live_…` key. Replace `SUPERLOG_TEST` in the env files / deploy targets above with it." Then auto-open:

- macOS: `open "https://superlog.sh/signup?from=skill"`
- Linux: `xdg-open "https://superlog.sh/signup?from=skill"`
- Windows: `start "" "https://superlog.sh/signup?from=skill"`

`?from=skill` tells the web app to skip its in-app install agent (you already did the work) and land the user on Settings with their key visible to copy.

If `open` / `xdg-open` isn't available or returns non-zero, just print the URL — don't fail the skill.

**Don't loop waiting for the user to paste the key back.** Once they swap `SUPERLOG_TEST` for the real key, telemetry starts flowing on its own at https://superlog.sh/dash.

### Suggest the Superlog MCP for next time

Before ending the skill, suggest installing the Superlog MCP server so the agent (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, etc.) can query their telemetry directly the next time they're debugging — search logs, pull traces, check error rates from inside the chat without context-switching to the dashboard.

For Claude Code (which is what the user is running this skill in, by far the most likely case):

```
claude mcp add --transport http superlog https://api.superlog.sh/mcp
```

Mention but don't run the equivalents for other agents in case they use more than one:

- Codex: `codex mcp add superlog --url https://api.superlog.sh/mcp && codex mcp login superlog`
- Cursor / others: copy the `mcpServers` snippet from https://superlog.sh/dash → Connect.

Frame this as a suggestion, not a step you execute. The user has to opt in to MCP servers and may not want one yet.

## Hard rules

- Never modify files outside the project root.
- Never commit, push, or open PRs.
- Never embed the ingest key as a literal in source — env files only.
- Never remove an existing observability vendor unless the user asks for it.
- Use the project's existing package manager and existing logger.
- Prefer native OTel packages for the language; don't reinvent telemetry plumbing the SDK already provides.
- If the dev/build command errors out *because of* your instrumentation, that's a failure — fix it or report it, don't paper over it.
